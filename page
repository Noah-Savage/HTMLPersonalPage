Here is a table of my favorite restaurants with links to their websites!<br><br>

While Cane's has quite good food, it's a food you have to be in the mood for. <br>
Wendy's is great because with their amazing prices and above average quality, <br>
you really can't go wrong when you step inside. Taco Bell is on the list for the <br>
obvious reason, the coveted Baja Blast. And as a Cincinnati native, it seems <br>
almost blasphemous to not include Skyline as a staple of fine dining. </align="center"><br><br><br>
<align="left"> <br> Other hobbies of mine include competitive paintball at <font color = "red"> Ohio State University <font color = #0084b8>
as well as playing <font color = "black"> roller hockey <font color = #0084b8> with the <br>
<font color = "red"> Ohio State Roller Hockey Club. <font color = #0084b8> I also make pizzas at the <font color = "red"> PAD at Ohio State <font color = #0084b8>
in the lobby of <font color = "red"> Lawrence Tower. <font color = #0084b8> I enjoy <br>
playing video games, namely <font color = "blue"> Rocket League, Insurgency: Sandstorm, Beat Saber, Pavlov VR, Onward, and Battlefield 1. <br>
